	<p><strong>Ebean borrows from a subset of the JPA specification that allows you to markup how your objects map to the database using Java annotations.</strong></p>
	<p>You can hand code your entity classes, or use software such as the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/dali/">Dail Toolkit</a> for the Eclipse IDE to auto-generate
	classes from your database.</p>
	<p>This entity class represents a site user who reviews products on a website. It was generated by Dali:</p>

	    <p>Notes:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>The <code>userId</code> field's annotations reflect that it is mapped to a primary key field with auto-increment enabled.</li>
	        <li>The <code>productReviews</code> field illustrates how one to many relationships within the database can be managed.</li>
	        <li><em>Ebean enhances the bytecode of the getter and setter methods so that appropriate actions against the database occur when they are called.</em></li>
