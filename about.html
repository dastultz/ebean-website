        <p><strong>Ebean is an open source "Object Relational Mapping" toolkit for Java. This means it gives you
        a way to query SQL databases using Java statements and automatically load, save and update database data using Java objects.</strong></p>
        
	    <p>The goal of Ebean is to provide a simpler alternative to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA (Java Persistence Architecture)</a> ORM implementations
	    such as <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/">EclipseLink</a>.</p> 
	    
	    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	        JPA was developed to satisfy numerous demands from existing
            ORM vendors and powerful players in the JEE space with the consequence it is far too complex for todays agile development approach.
	    </div>

	    <p>Ebean's objectives are to:</p>
	    
	    <ul>
	       <li>Provide an ORM toolkit that is fast to learn, code against and maintain.</li>
	       <li>Support developers in their quest to create clean, concise code.</li>
	       <li>Use programming extractions that increase safety while providing maximum performance.</li>
	       <li>Be nothing more than a thin layer over databases and not get in the way of developers.</li>
	       <li>Allow SQL to be a first class citizen when developers want to use it.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	        <p>Ebean achieves this by providing a clean “sessionless” API and simpler query language.<br/>Relative to JPA, this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No Session Object (or UnitOfWork or EntityManager).</li>
                <li>No Attached or Detached Beans.</li>
                <li>No merge(), persist(), flush(), or clear(). Instead Ebean has save() and delete().</li>
                <li>You can load objects with raw SQL if you want.</li>
            </ul>

		<p>Ebean has been in production for 5 years and is pre-integrated into the popular <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play</a> framework.</p>
